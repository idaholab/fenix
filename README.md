# FENIX
Fusion ENergy Integrated multiphys-X (FENIX) Framework
=====

FENIX is an application for performing system-level, engineering scale (i.e., at the scale of
centimeters and meters), and microstructure-scale (i.e., at the scale of microns) multiphysics
calculations related to fusion energy systems.
These models often include highly coupled systems of equations related to plasma physics,
electromagnetics, heat conduction, scalar transport, thermal hydraulics, computational fluid dynamics,
and thermomechanics, amongst others.
Interfaces to other MOOSE-based codes, including tritium transport ([TMAP8](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/tmap8))
and neutronics ([Cardinal](https://cardinal.cels.anl.gov/)) are also included to support FENIX simulations.
FENIX will enable high-fidelity modeling of irradiation levels and plasma exposure
conditions of plasma facing components and their impact on heat and tritium distributions, as well
as the resulting mechanical constraints experienced by the plasma facing components.

The [FENIX documentation](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/fenix/index.html) includes the code reference, a getting started guide, and details about verification, validation, and examples case, etc.
